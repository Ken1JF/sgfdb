The sgfdb package consists of the following files:
	sgfdb - defines functions for reading and writing an SGF database,
        i.e. a directory of directories of .sgf files (such as GoGoD)
	
The GoGoD database of professional Go games is available for purchase from:
	http://www.gogod.co.uk/
and makes an excellent test database.

		CountFilesAndMoves and CountDirectory
		=====================================

These two functions, together with servers and channels provides an 
    example of how to take advantage of multiple processors and threads 
    in processing an SGF database.

The function CountFilesAndMoves uses ioutil.ReadDir to read the base 
    directory. It then calls startServers, which sets up some communication 
    channels and starts two servers, a request server and result server. 
    CountFilesAndMoves then iterates through the directories, builds a request 
    for each sub-directory and sends each request to the request channel. 

The result is a count of the number of files and the number of nodes (semi-colons) 
    in each directory.
		
		ReadAndWriteDatabase and ReadAndWriteDirectory
		==============================================
	
The function ReadAndWriteDatabase iterates through directories in the 
    base directory, calling the function ReadAndWriteDirectory. This function 
    iterates through the .sgf files in each directory, calling ioutil.ReadFile 
    and sgf.ParseFile to build a parse tree. ReadAndWriteDirectory then 
    calls sgf.WriteFile to write a copy of each files in a copy of each 
    directory in the directory /testout.

There is a script, compareSGFs.txt, which is used to compare the 
    original SGF files to the ones written by sgf.WriteFile. It uses
    the program diffsgf which ignores white space.
